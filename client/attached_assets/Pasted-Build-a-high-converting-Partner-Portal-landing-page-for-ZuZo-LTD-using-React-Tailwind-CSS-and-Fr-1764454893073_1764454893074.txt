Build a high-converting "Partner Portal" landing page for ZuZo LTD using React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

The goal is to position ZuZo not as a "Call Center" but as a "Fulfillment Platform" for white-label partners in the US, Canada, and Australia. The design should feel like a SaaS product (think Stripe or Deel), not a traditional corporate service site.

Design Guidelines:
Vibe: "Invisible Engine." Clean, minimalist, tech-forward. Dark mode options.

Colors: Deep navy blue, electric purple accents, and stark white text.

Typography: Inter or Geist (modern sans-serif).

Imagery: Abstract data visualizations or server nodes connecting globally. NO stock photos of people in headsets.

Page Structure & Copy Requirements:
1. Hero Section:

Headline: "Scale Your Margins, Not Your Headcount."

Subheadline: "The invisible fulfillment engine for MSPs, Master Agents, and NDIS Providers. You own the client relationship; we power the delivery from Ghana."

CTA Button: "Calculate Your Margin Impact" (Smooth scroll to calculator).

2. The "Arbitrage" Value Proposition (Grid Layout):

Card 1 (For MSPs): "Tier 1 Helpdesk, Solved." Stop burning out US engineers on password resets. 24/7 coverage starting at $8/hr.

Card 2 (For Master Agents): "Zero-Churn Fulfillment." 4.7/5 CSAT scores that protect your reputation and your residuals.

Card 3 (For NDIS Providers): "Overnight Claim Processing." We process claims while Australia sleeps. Wake up to a cleared queue.

3. Interactive Element: The "Margin Calculator" (Critical Feature):

Create a functional slider tool titled: "The After-Hours Helpdesk Calculator".

Input: "Number of US/Canada Agents" (Range 1-50).

Input: "Current Hourly Wage" (Default $25).

Logic: Calculate monthly cost vs. ZuZo cost (assume ZuZo is $9/hr).

Output: Show a large, animated green number: "Annual Margin Reclaimed: $[Amount]".

4. The "Partner Tracks" Section (Tabs):

Tab A: White Label (The Ghost): "We wear your jersey. We use your email domain. We work in your ticketing system (ConnectWise/Salesforce)."

Tab B: Referral (The Broker): "Simple hand-off. You introduce, we close, you earn lifetime recurring commissions."

5. Gated Asset Library (Lead Gen):

Create a "Partner Resources" section with two distinct "Download Cards" (use mock file icons):

Asset 1: "Australia NDIS Growth Pack." (Copy: How to double your plan management capacity without hiring locally).

Asset 2: "The MSP Night Shift Protocol." (Copy: A guide to profitable 24/7 coverage for US/Canadian MSPs).

Functionality: Clicking "Download" should trigger a simple modal asking for "Work Email".

6. Trust & Compliance Footer:

Do not show client logos. Show compliance badges instead to build trust: ISO 27001, GDPR Compliant, HIPAA Ready, SOC2 Ready.

Final CTA: "Become a Launch Partner."

Technical Requirements:
Make the site fully responsive (mobile optimized).

Use smooth scrolling for navigation.

Ensure the "Margin Calculator" updates in real-time as the slider moves.
