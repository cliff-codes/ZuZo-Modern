Based on the **Partnership Tier Pricing** image you shared and the "Master Agent/White Label" strategy we are building, the FAQ section needs to do heavy lifting. It must answer the "silent" questions partners are too afraid to ask—specifically about **money, client ownership, and quality control.**

Here is the recommended FAQ content to add to the Partner Portal. It is designed to be transparent enough to build trust, but professional enough to protect ZuZo’s interests.

### **Section 1: Commercials & The "Margin" Model**
*Context: This explains the "35%-50% Margin" shown in your image without revealing your raw costs.*

**Q: How does the "Margin Per Agent" model actually work?**
**A:** We operate on a **Wholesale BPO** model. ZuZo provides you with a "Buy Rate" (e.g., for a dedicated agent) that is significantly lower than market value. You are free to set your own "Sell Rate" to your end-client.
*   *Example:* If your Buy Rate is $9/hr and you sell the seat at $18/hr, you keep 50% margin. We do not dictate your pricing strategy.

**Q: What is included in the "Tier 2 & 3" pricing?**
**A:** Unlike the Starter tier, Tiers 2 and 3 include our **"Rapid Implementation Protocol"** (setup in <14 days) and a **Dedicated Partner Success Manager**. This manager is your single point of contact, ensuring you don't have to manage the agents yourself—we manage the performance, you manage the client relationship.

**Q: Do I pay for agents when they aren't on calls?**
**A:** Our standard model is **Dedicated Staffing**, meaning you pay a flat monthly rate for a dedicated resource who works exclusively for your brand (or your client's brand). This ensures they are fully trained on *your* specific SOPs and culture, unlike a shared "minute-based" call center.

### **Section 2: Invisibility & Client Ownership (Crucial for MSPs)**
*Context: Partners are terrified you will steal their clients. You must kill this fear immediately.*

**Q: Will my clients know I am outsourcing to ZuZo?**
**A:** No. We operate as a **100% White Label extension** of your team.
*   **Email:** We use your domain (e.g., `support@youragency.com`).
*   **Phone:** We answer with your custom greeting.
*   **Systems:** We work directly inside your ticketing system (ConnectWise, Zendesk, Salesforce).
To your client, our agent is just another member of your team—they just happen to be sitting in Accra.

**Q: How do you protect my client relationship? (Non-Solicitation)**
**A:** Trust is our currency. All Partnership Agreements include a strict **Non-Solicitation & Non-Compete Clause**. ZuZo is legally bound not to solicit or accept business directly from your end-clients. Your book of business belongs to you, forever.

**Q: Can I visit the facility or send my clients to visit?**
**A:** Absolutely. We encourage it. If you bring a client to our Accra facility, we will rebrand the meeting space with *your* agency's logo for the day. We are *your* office in Africa.

### **Section 3: Operations & Quality Control**
*Context: Addressing the "Quality" concerns raised in your CSAT 4.7 score.*

**Q: How do you handle accents and cultural nuances?**
**A:** Ghana is a Commonwealth nation with English as the official language. Our agents are college-educated and speak with a **neutral, "Global English" accent** that is highly rated for clarity in US and UK markets. We invite you to "blind test" our agents before signing a contract.

**Q: How do I monitor quality if I'm not there?**
**A:** Radical transparency. As a partner, you get:
1.  **Real-Time Access:** Login access to call recordings and live screen monitoring.
2.  **Weekly Calibration:** A weekly QA score (CSAT/QA) report sent to you.
3.  **The "Red Flag" System:** If an agent falls below your KPI threshold for 2 weeks, we automatically place them on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) or replace them at no cost to you.

**Q: What happens if I need to scale up for a busy season (like Q4)?**
**A:** This is where our **Tier 3 (Enterprise)** status shines. We maintain a "bench" of pre-vetted talent. For partners in the Growth or Enterprise tiers, we can ramp up 5-10 additional agents in as little as 10 business days.

### **Section 4: Technology & Security**
*Context: For the NDIS and MSP partners who have strict data laws.*

**Q: How do you handle Data Sovereignty (GDPR/Australian Privacy)?**
**A:** We utilize a **VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure)** environment. This means your customer data never actually leaves your server; our agents merely view it through a secure, encrypted window. No data is stored locally on hard drives in Ghana, ensuring full compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and Australian Privacy Principles.

**Q: What technical setup is required from my side?**
**A:** Very little. We need:
1.  Provisioned licenses for your tools (e.g., a seat on your Salesforce/Zendesk).
2.  VPN access (if required).
3.  Training manuals (SOPs).
Our IT team handles the rest, ensuring our hardware matches your security specs.
