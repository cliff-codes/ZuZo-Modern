Yes, absolutely. **Fulfillment Centers (3PLs)** are actually one of the most lucrative partner categories for ZuZo because they suffer from a specific, high-volume pain point: **"WISMO" (Where Is My Order?) calls.**

Logistics companies are great at moving boxes, but they often hate handling the thousands of "My package is late" tickets that come with it. They are the perfect candidate for a white-label support partner.

Here is how you should update the **Replit Prompt** to specifically cater to them on the Partner Portal.

### **1. Update the "Subheadline"**
*   **Current:** "...for MSPs, Master Agents, and NDIS Providers."
*   **Change to:** "...for MSPs, **3PLs**, and NDIS Providers."

### **2. Add a 4th Card to the "Arbitrage" Grid**
Add this specific card to the design instructions. It speaks their language (WISMO):

*   **Card 4 (For Fulfillment Centers):** "The WISMO Killer. Logistics margins are thin. Don't let 'Where is my order?' tickets eat your profits. We handle tracking inquiries, claims, and returns for **$8/hr**, integrating directly with ShipStation or Shopify."

### **3. Update the "Margin Calculator" Logic**
Fulfillment partners think in terms of **"Cost Per Ticket"** rather than just hourly rates.
*   **Add this instruction to the Calculator section:**
    *   *New Input Option:* "Monthly Ticket Volume" (e.g., 5,000 tickets).
    *   *Comparison Logic:* Average US cost per ticket ($6.50) vs. ZuZo cost per ticket ($1.80).
    *   *Output:* "Annual Savings on Support Tickets."

### **4. Add a New "Gated Asset" (Lead Magnet)**
Fulfillment centers are terrified of Q4 (Holiday Peak Season). Use that fear to get their email.
*   **Asset 3:** "The Peak Season Survival Guide."
*   **Copy:** "How to scale your support team from 5 to 50 agents for Black Friday—without hiring a single full-time employee."

### **Summary of the Strategy for Fulfillment Partners**
When pitching or building this page for them, remember their three biggest headaches:
1.  **WISMO Spikes:** When a storm hits or a carrier delays, their phones blow up. They need ZuZo to be the "overflow valve."
2.  **Returns Management (RMA):** It is tedious, manual work. Pitch ZuZo agents as "RMA Processors" who validate returns before the warehouse touches them.
3.  **Seasonal Scaling:** They make 60% of their money in Nov/Dec. They need a partner who can ramp up for 2 months and then ramp down.
