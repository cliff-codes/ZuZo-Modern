Based on the research into **VCALL Global**, **Master Agents** (like Telarus/Intelisys), **MSPs**, and **Australian NDIS providers**, partners do not just want to know what software *you* use; they want to know that your team can work inside *their* software stack from day one.

For the **Partner Portal**, this section should be titled **"The Interoperability Stack"** or **"Technology Agnostic Delivery."**

Here is the 2025 Tech Stack ZuZo needs to display to win these specific partners.

### **1. The "Master Agent" & Telco Stack (Crucial for VCALL/Telarus/Intelisys)**
Master Agents sell Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) software. They need a BPO partner who is already trained on the platforms they sell. **Displaying these logos proves you are a "Plug-and-Play" partner.**

*   **Headline:** *"Certified Capabilities on the World's Leading CCaaS Platforms"*
*   **The List (Must-Haves):**
    *   **Five9** (The #1 resell target for Master Agents).
    *   **Nice CXone** (Enterprise standard).
    *   **Genesys Cloud CX** (High-end enterprise).
    *   **RingCentral** (Common for mid-market).
    *   **Talkdesk** (Popular with modern tech startups).
    *   **Dialpad** (AI-heavy, growing fast in 2025).
*   **The Pitch:** *"Don't let a software migration kill your deal. Our agents are pre-trained on Five9 and Genesys, reducing your client's 'Time to Value' by 40%."*

### **2. The "MSP & IT Support" Stack (Crucial for US/Canada MSPs)**
Managed Service Providers (MSPs) live and die by their ticketing systems (PSA) and monitoring tools (RMM). They will **not** hire ZuZo if your agents cannot navigate these tools.

*   **Headline:** *"Seamless Integration into Your ITSM Workflow"*
*   **Ticketing (PSA):**
    *   **ConnectWise PSA** (The industry standard; non-negotiable).
    *   **Autotask** (Datto/Kaseya).
    *   **HaloPSA** (The fastest-growing PSA in 2025).
    *   **ServiceNow** (For enterprise IT helpdesk).
*   **Monitoring (RMM):**
    *   **NinjaOne** (Very popular with modern MSPs).
    *   **ConnectWise Automate**.
    *   **Kaseya VSA**.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   **IT Glue** (Your agents must know how to look up SOPs here).
*   **The Pitch:** *"We don't work in silos. Our Tier 1 techs work directly inside your ConnectWise/HaloPSA board, documenting every step in IT Glue."*

### **3. The "Logistics & E-Commerce" Stack (For 3PLs/ShipBob)**
For Fulfillment partners, the tech stack is about **Order Management Systems (OMS)** and **CX ticketing**.

*   **Headline:** *"E-Commerce & Logistics Support Engine"*
*   **Support Platforms:**
    *   **Gorgias** (The #1 helpdesk for Shopify stores—critical).
    *   **Zendesk** (The standard for larger logistics firms).
    *   **Intercom** (For SaaS and tech-forward brands).
*   **Back-End Systems:**
    *   **Shopify Plus** (Must be proficient in order edits/refunds).
    *   **ShipStation** (For tracking and shipping labels).
    *   **NetSuite** (ERP for larger 3PLs).
    *   **AfterShip** (Tracking updates).
*   **The Pitch:** *"We resolve 'Where is my order?' tickets directly in Gorgias and ShipStation, without escalating to your warehouse manager."*

### **4. The "Australian NDIS" Stack (Crucial for the AU Market)**
This is highly specific. Australian partners need assurance you understand their government portals.

*   **Headline:** *"NDIS & Allied Health Administration"*
*   **Government Portals:**
    *   **PRODA** (Provider Digital Access) – *Listing this is an instant trust signal.*
    *   **PACE** (The new NDIS computer system).
*   **Plan Management Software:**
    *   **Lumary** (Market leader).
    *   **CareMaster**.
    *   **ShiftCare**.
    *   **Brevity**.
*   **Accounting (AU Standard):**
    *   **Xero** (Must-have).
    *   **MYOB**.
*   **The Pitch:** *"Our admin teams are PRODA-verified and experienced in Lumary and Xero, ensuring compliant, overnight invoice processing."*

### **5. The "Security & Compliance" Stack (The Trust Layer)**
Since you are in Ghana (offshore), partners will have security concerns. You must display your **Security Stack** to kill these objections immediately.

*   **Headline:** *"Enterprise-Grade Data Sovereignty"*
*   **Infrastructure:**
    *   **Citrix / Amazon WorkSpaces (VDI):** *Shows that no data is stored locally in Ghana.*
    *   **CrowdStrike / SentinelOne:** *Endpoint protection.*
*   **Compliance Badges (Visuals):**
    *   **SOC 2 Type II** (Ready/Certified).
    *   **GDPR** (For UK/Europe partners).
    *   **HIPAA** (For US Healthcare partners).
    *   **PCI-DSS Level 1** (For payments).
